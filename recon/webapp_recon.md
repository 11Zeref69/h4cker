# Web Application Security Testing Methodology

## 1. Mapping the Application

Mapping the application is a critical initial phase in security testing. It involves understanding the visible and underlying structure of the application to effectively tailor the testing strategy.

### Explore Visible Content
- **Objective**: Identify all publicly accessible endpoints and files.
- **Methods**: Use tools like web crawlers and directory brute forcing tools.

### Consult Public Resources
- **Objective**: Gather information from publicly available sources.
- **Methods**: Check documentation, forums, and other related publications.

### Discover Hidden Content
- **Objective**: Uncover potentially hidden or non-indexed directories and files.
- **Methods**: Employ tools that perform forced browsing and directory listing.

### Discover Default Content
- **Objective**: Identify common or default files and directories.
- **Methods**: Use lists of known default installation paths and filenames.

### Enumerate Identifier-Specified Functions
- **Objective**: Determine the functionality exposed through URL parameters or function-specific paths.
- **Methods**: Analyze URL patterns and parameter names for hints of underlying functionality.

### Test for Debug Parameters
- **Objective**: Discover any leftover or undocumented debug parameters that could expose sensitive information.
- **Methods**: Attempt common debug parameter names and observe responses for changes in behavior or information disclosure.

## 2. Analyze the Application

This step involves a deeper analysis of the application's build and behavior to identify potential security vulnerabilities.

### Identify Functionality
- **Objective**: Catalog all functions the application performs.
- **Methods**: Systematic usage and testing of all features.

### Identify Data Entry Points
- **Objective**: List all points where user input is accepted.
- **Methods**: Review forms, API endpoints, and any other interfaces.

### Identify the Technologies Used
- **Objective**: Determine all underlying technologies (frameworks, libraries, servers).
- **Methods**: HTTP headers, file extensions, and error messages can reveal software versions and types.

### Map the Attack Surface
- **Objective**: Understand all areas of the application that can potentially be attacked.
- **Methods**: Combine the information from functionality, data entry points, and technology identification to visualize the complete attack surface.
